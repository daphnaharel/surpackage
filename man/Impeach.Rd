\description{
On February 12, 1999, for only the second time in the nation’s history, the U.S. Senate voted on whether to remove a president, based on impeachment articles passed by the U.S. House. Professor Alan Reifman of Texas Tech University created the dataset consisting of descriptions of each senator that can be used to understand some of the reasons that the senators voted the way they did. The data are taken from the Journal of Statistics Education [online].
