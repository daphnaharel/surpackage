\description{
This fictional dataset contains the treatment group number and the manual dexterity scores for 30 individuals selected by the director of a drug rehabilitation center. There are three treatments, and the individuals are randomly assigned ten to a treatment. After five weeks of treatment, a manual dexterity test is administered for which a higher score indicates greater manual dexterity.
